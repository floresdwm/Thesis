# Food science and technology automated multivariate regression program

This project is part of my phD thesis. 
The aim of this work is enable people of food science and technology area to work with Python for data science/chemometrics.
Python could be used to analyze near infrared spectroscopy or time domain nuclear magnetic ressonance data and build machine learning
models to predict quality parameters using only the aquired instrumentation signal.
This program could be used to fast evaluate dataset for this purpose.
